Phew! Enough arithmetic for now. In fact, enough for numbers period.

Now let's take a look at a different kind of variable, called a **string**. We call it a **string**, because it's a string of characters in sequence.

If you had to store your name in a variable in JavaScript, it would be stored in a string.

Let's have a look.

Here we assign a value of `wolf` to a variable called `evilVillain`. As you can see, to create a string you wrap the characters you want in the string with quote `'` characters.

####String assignment
    var evilVillain = 'wolf';

It's also valid to assign a string variable with double quote `"` characters.

####String assignment with double quotes
    var evilVillain = "wolf";

If you need a string with quote characters, you might need to **escape** them with a `\` character.

####String with quotes
    var line = "\"I'll blow your house down!\", said the wolf.";
